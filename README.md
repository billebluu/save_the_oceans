## Description
Save the Oceans is a game created using Greenfoot. This game can be played on the Greenfoot website and is developed using the Java programming language with the concept of object-oriented programming. The game aims to educate players about the importance of environmental conservation, especially in water bodies, due to the increasing volume of waste in water caused by poor waste management on land. This situation has a negative impact on the marine ecosystem and marine life as a whole.

Save the Oceans features educational content about the most commonly found marine litter, a player's guide, an interesting backstory, selectable characters, and challenging missions.

Players will control the main character, a mermaid, and must collect trash and reach specified targets in each mission. There are 4 main missions and 2 bonus missions that players need to complete. However, players must be cautious to avoid hazardous objects, poison bottles and nets, to prevent the loss of health points or a game over.

## How to Play
1. Visit [Save the Oceans](https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/30073) to play the game.
2. Use the left arrow (‚Üê) and right arrow (‚Üí) keys to move the mermaid character left and right.
3. Players need to guide the mermaid to collect trash and reach the targets given in each mission.
4. Avoid hazardous objects like poison bottles, nets, and trash, as they will reduce the score or health points.
5. Complete all main and bonus missions to finish the game.
